      Hello! I'm Jyotika, a recent Computer Science graduate from Amity University, Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior. I have a strong passion for Web Development, UI/UX Designing, and Databases, where I get to combine my love for technology with my passion for art and design. I enjoy using my creativity and problem-solving skills to create digital experiences that not only look great but also work seamlessly for the user. <br /> <br />
      Outside of my professional life, I have a range of personal interests that keep me inspired and balanced. I enjoy reading novels, photography, dancing, and playing sports like badminton, skating, and cricket (both playing and watching). In my free time, I also indulge in artistic pursuits and love to watch movies.    
      I am currently exploring job opportunities where I can contribute my skills to innovative projects, collaborate with dynamic teams, and continue to grow professionally.
      
      Feel free to explore my portfolio, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!
