        Hi, I'm Jyotika Dalal, a passionate Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer with a strong foundation in creating engaging and intuitive user experiences. With a background in Computer Science and Engineering, I've honed my skills in modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and SQL, and have a keen eye for design that balances aesthetics with functionality. My journey has taken me from coding dynamic web applications to crafting visually appealing interfaces that solve real-world problems. I enjoy working at the intersection of creativity and technology, continuously learning to improve my craft. Whether itâ€™s designing a seamless user journey, developing responsive interfaces, or contributing to backend logic, I approach every project with enthusiasm and attention to detail. In addition to my professional skills, I love exploring photography, dancing, and outdoor sports, which often inspire the creativity I bring to my work. Welcome to my portfolio, and I hope my projects resonate with you!
